/**
 * An object describing the what to be rendered and how by {@link RenderContext.render}.
 * @remarks
 * The render state is immutable by design.
 * You should not attempt to mutate existing objects.
 * The correct way to change render state is to use the {@link modifyRenderState} function.
 * This function will create a new copy of objects with new/modified properties, while retaining all objects that hasn't changed.
 * It will also perform basic validation.
 * The engine uses {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Strict_equality | strict equality} to determine if some portion of the state has changed.
 * Hence, it's important that unchanged sub objects are not copied.
 * 
 * The render state is serializable via JSON or {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/structuredClone | structuredClone()}.
 * This can be useful for test/diagnostics purposes, since the render state should define how the output image eventually is rendered.
 * It may take a while for downloads of streamed resources to complete, however, so the output image will not be fully resolved until all pending downloads are complete.
 * There are also other runtime factors, such as device specific limitations or variations, that may contribute to small deviations in the output image.
 * A direct pixel to pixel comparison between two output images generated by identical render state is thus likely to fail unless it's rendered on the same device and same version of our API, browser, OS and drivers.
